# Classification of Neuron Dendrite Types by Electrophysiological Properties
This project is a part of the Master's thesis and aims to discover the possible ways of neuron classification by appling unsupervised machine learning (ML) models to electrophysiological properties of human neurons recorded by Allen Institute for Brain Science (AIBS). Furthermore, supervised ML models were applied to address the question of whether electrophysiological features can be used to predict dendrite type, a morphological property determined by examining the image of each neuron in the database.
